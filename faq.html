                                        <li><b>What is a disaster?</b><br>
                                            A disaster is an unexpected accident resulting from natural or man-made
                                            factors (or a combination of both) that has a negative impact on the daily
                                            lives and living conditions of humans and flora/fauna.

                                            <p>
                                        <li><b>What are the different kinds of disasters?</b><br>
                                            There are different types of disasters that have a high impact. Natural
                                            disasters include floods, droughts, earthquakes, cyclones, hurricanes,
                                            tornadoes, typhoons, landslides, volcanic eruptions etc. Man-made disasters
                                            can include chemical accidents, oil spills, radiological accidents,
                                            conflicts/wars, mass population displacement or refugee emigration, forest
                                            fires etc.

                                            <p>
                                        <li><b>Why are disasters occurring?</b><br>
                                            There are a number of reasons for the increasing frequency and
                                            severity/intensity of disasters that we are currently observing. One of the
                                            key reasons is a growing vulnerability due to demographic and land use
                                            changes. Increasing population, particularly in developing countries, places
                                            a greater burden on resources needed to sustain this population.

                                        <li><b>What are the human causes?</b><br>
                                            A decline of urban habitats through unplanned urban growth, expansion of
                                            urban areas and massive over-loading of city systems has led to cumulative
                                            problems not only within the cities, but also far beyond their boundaries.
                                            This is particularly true when we take into account the life styles and
                                            consumption patterns that we are currently seeing in cities. For example,
                                            need for food and timber for building has increased erosion of topsoil due
                                            to deforestation, draining of wetlands. This has eroded the natural defenses
                                            against disasters such as flooding and desertification.

                                        <li><b>What are the challenges to mitigate disasters?</b><br>
                                            We need to recognize the fact that natural disasters are increasing in both
                                            frequency and intensity. Their impact on human lives and livelihoods, and
                                            the economy as a whole, is also increasing, due to higher population numbers
                                            and densities. Simultaneously, disasters caused as a result of human
                                            activities are also increasing, notwithstanding the awareness campaigns and
                                            strategic programming undertaken. Capacity to combat disasters in developing
                                            countries is particularly weak, and disaster preparedness strategies and
                                            programmes need to be built into ongoing developmental efforts, and link it
                                            to broader economic development. A number of stakeholders, at the global,
                                            national, sub-regional and local levels need to come together with different
                                            resources to deal with disaster mitigation.

                                        <li><b>What are the elements of disaster preparedness and mitigation?</b><br>
                                            One of the key aspects in disaster mitigation is to take into account all
                                            aspects of a disaster - and not just human relief and rehabilitation.
                                            Economic, social and environmental impacts need to be anticipated and
                                            appropriate measures taken. The entire disaster cycle of prevention,
                                            preparedness, assessment, mitigation and response should be part of any
                                            disaster mitigation plans.
                                            <p>
                                                Prevention and preparedness need to be the cornerstone of any emergency
                                                plan. Anticipating the level of damage with geographical information
                                                systems, simulation software, early warning etc. are also critical
                                                elements of a good disaster preparedness and mitigation plan. This has
                                                to be integrated with a post-disaster assessment, which can be used to
                                                draw lessons for preparedness and mitigation.

                                        <li><b>What should disaster mitigation plans aim for?</b><br>
                                            Initiatives dealing with disasters need to examine and assess disasters, as
                                            well as circumstances underlying their occurrence. It should cover various
                                            laws and regulations, designed to mitigate and prepare for disasters. It
                                            should also demonstrate how well informed, grass-root organizations can
                                            successfully implement disaster management programmes.
